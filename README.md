# OpenIn App By Listed Inc.

This project adheres to modern Android development practices and adopts a single activity architecture to enhance scalability and ease of maintenance.

The project implements the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which offers several features and advantages:
- Separation of Concerns
- Testability
- Reactive Programming
- Maintainability and Scalability
- Code Reusability

The OpenInApp project incorporates various key components such as Navigation, Single Activity Architecture, MVVM, StateFlow, and Coroutines. These components work together to enhance the project's functionality and structure.

For the testing phase, I utilized MockWebServer and OkHttp Idling Resource to set up a mocked API response. This setup allowed us to verify the behavior of the application in the event of changes to the attributes in the API response. By simulating different scenarios, we ensured that the app responded correctly and handled any variations in the API data.

To visualize the data in a graph, the project utilizes the MpChart library. The data is displayed in the graph, as per the provided API specifications.

## Lessons Learned

Before starting this project, I had limited experience with visualizing graphs in Android, which initially posed a challenge. However, with the assistance of the MpChart library, I was able to overcome this challenge and gain a thorough understanding of displaying charts in a proper and effective manner. I would like to express my gratitude for assigning me this task, as it provided an opportunity for valuable learning and growth.

## Further Improvements

Writing test cases is essential to instill confidence in the code and ensure its readiness for production. By creating comprehensive tests, we can verify the functionality and behavior of the code, increasing its reliability.

To streamline the testing process, CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines can be established. These pipelines automate the execution of test cases, allowing for seamless and frequent testing of the codebase. By integrating testing into the development workflow, potential issues and regressions can be identified early on, ensuring a stable and high-quality software release.
